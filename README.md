# PlantCV Photosynthesis Tutorial, Multi-Object

[![test-pr](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv-tutorial-photosynthesis-multi/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv-tutorial-photosynthesis-multi/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml)

This tutorial describes how to analyze the following photosynthetic paramters from chlorophyll fluorescence images: Fv/Fm, NPQ, Fq'/Fm', chlorophyll index, anthocyanin index, leaf area, and other shape characteristics. This tutorial utilizes images taken from a Phenovation CropReporter using OJIP protocols, but other chlorophyll fluorescence images are also applicable. This tutorial specifically is for multi-objects - such as multiple plants or multiple leaves.
