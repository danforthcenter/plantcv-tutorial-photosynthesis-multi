# PlantCV Photosynthesis Tutorial, Multi-Object

This tutorial describes how to analyze the following photosynthetic paramters from chlorophyll fluorescence images: Fv/Fm, NPQ, Fq'/Fm', chlorophyll index, anthocyanin index, leaf area, and other shape characteristics. This tutorial utilizes images taken from a Phenovation CropReporter using OJIP protocols, but other chlorophyll fluorescence images are also applicable. This tutorial specifically is for multi-objects - such as multiple plants or multiple leaves.
